def mesh_boundary ( element_node ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## mesh_boundary() determines the segments forming a mesh boundary.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    This function can be applied to meshes constructed from
#    a number of 2D polygonal elements.  The elements can be a mixture of
#    triangles, quadrilaterals, or other polygons.  In addition,
#    this function can handle a 3D surface meshed by 2D elements.
#
#    The elements can be linear (vertices only), quadratic (extra nodes 
#    along edges), or higher degree.  However, the input to this function
#    should only list the element nodes that lie on the element boundary,
#    and this must be done in counter clockwise order.
#
#    For instance, a quadratic Lagrange element might have the following
#    form:
#
#      80--90-100
#       |       |
#      79  89  99
#       |       |
#      78--88--98
#
#    Assuming this is element #17, then the corresponding entry in the 
#    element node dictionary should be something like:
#
#      17: np.array ( [ 78, 88, 98, 99, 100, 90, 80, 79 ] )
#
#    so that only the nodes on the element boundary are listed, the nodes
#    are listed in counter clockwise order.
#
#    Currently, the program cannot properly report the existence of
#    internal holes in the mesh.
#
#  Example:
#
#    Consider the following simple quadrilateral mesh:
#
#      1---2---3
#      |   |   |
#      4---5---6
#      |   |   |
#      7---8---9
#
#    for which the element array is:
#
#      element_node = [
#        [ 4, 5, 2, 1 ],
#        [ 5, 6, 3, 2 ],
#        [ 7, 8, 5, 4 ],
#        [ 8, 9, 6, 5 ] ]
#
#    This function will return the boundary segments array: 
#
#      boundary_segments = [
#        [ 1, 4 ]
#        [ 4, 7 ],
#        [ 7, 8 ],
#        [ 8, 9 ],
#        [ 9, 6 ],
#        [ 6, 3 ],
#        [ 3, 2 ],
#        [ 2, 1 ] ]

#  Input:
