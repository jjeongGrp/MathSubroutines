#
#    The equation describes the radius of a ball of flame that
#    begins, at time 0, at DELTA.
#
#      Y(0) = DELTA
#
#    The rate of fuel consumption is proportional to the volume, and
#    the rate of fuel intake is proportional to the area of the ball.
#    We take the constant of proportionality to be 1.
#
#      Y' = Y^2 - Y^3
#
#    The data is normalized so that Y = 1 is the equilibrium solution.
#
#    The computation is to be made from T = 0 to T = 2/DELTA.
#
#    For values of DELTA close to 1, such as 0.01, the equation is
#    not stiff.  But for DELTA = 0.0001, the equation can become
#    stiff as the solution approaches the equilibrium solution Y = 1,
#    and computed solutions may be wildly inaccurate or cautious
#    solvers may take very small timesteps.
#
#    The exact solution involves the Lambert W function, defined by
#
#      W(z) * exp ( W(z) ) = z
#
#    and if we set
#
#      A = ( 1 / DELTA - 1 )
#
#    then
#
#      Y(T) = 1 / ( W(A*exp(A-T)) + 1 )
