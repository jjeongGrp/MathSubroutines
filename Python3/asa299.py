## simplex_lattice_point_next() generates lattice points in a simplex.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The simplex is defined by N-dimensional points X such that:
#
#        0 <= X(1:N)
#
#    and
#
#      sum ( X(1:N) ) <= T
#
#    where T is an integer.
#
#    Lattice points are points X which satisfy the simplex conditions and
#    for which all the components are integers.
#
#    This routine generates all the lattice points in a given simplex, one at
#    a time, in a reverse lexicographic order.
#
#    To use the routine, initialize by setting N and T to appropriate values,
#    and MORE to FALSE.  Initialize X to the empty vector, [].
#
#    Call the routine. On return, X will contain the first lattice point in
#    the simplex.  If MORE is TRUE, then the routine may be called again to
#    get the next point.  In fact, as long as the output value of MORE is
#    TRUE, there is at least one more lattice point that can be found by
#    making another call.  When MORE is returned as FALSE, then there are no
#    more lattice points the value of X returned at that time is the
#    "last" such point.
#
#    During the computation of a sequence of lattice points, the user should
#    not change the values of N, T, MORE or X.
#
#    The output for N = 3, T = 4 would be:
#
#       1    4  0  0
#       2    3  1  0
#       3    3  0  1
#       4    2  2  0
#       5    2  1  1
#       6    2  0  2
#       7    1  3  0
#       8    1  2  1
#       9    1  1  2
#      10    1  0  3
#      11    0  4  0
#      12    0  3  1
#      13    0  2  2
#      14    0  1  3

#  Input:
#
#    integer N, the spatial dimension.
#    N must be positive.
#
#    integer T, the characteristic of the simplex.
#    T must be nonnegative.
#
#    logical MORE, initialized to FALSE by the user to
#    begin a sequence of calculations.  Thereafter, the input value
#    should be the output value from the previous call.
#
#    integer X(N), should be initialized to [] on the very first

#  Output:

#    if there are more values of X that can be calculated, or FALSE
#    if the accompanying value of X is the last one for this sequence.
#
#    integer X(N), the next point in the sequence.
