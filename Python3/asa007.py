#  Discussion:
#
#    For a positive definite symmetric matrix A, the Cholesky factor U
#    is an upper triangular matrix such that A = U' * U.
#
#    This routine was originally named "CHOL", but that conflicts with
#    the name of a built in MATLAB routine.
#
#    The missing initialization "II = 0" has been added to the code.
